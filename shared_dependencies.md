1. Dependencies: All files share the dependencies defined in the "package.json" file. These include the Next.js framework, TypeScript, and any other libraries that are installed.

2. TypeScript Configuration: All TypeScript files (".tsx") share the configuration defined in the "tsconfig.json" file. This includes compiler options and type checking rules.

3. Next.js Configuration: All files are affected by the configuration defined in the ".next/config.js" file. This includes settings for server-side rendering and routing.

4. React Components: The "_app.tsx" and "_document.tsx" files are special Next.js files that wrap around all other pages. Therefore, any components, such as "Header.tsx" and "Footer.tsx", used in these files are shared across all pages.

5. CSS Styles: All components share the global styles defined in the "globals.css" file. Additionally, the "Home.module.css" file is shared by any components that require the styles defined in it.

6. Public Assets: All files have access to the public assets in the "public" directory. This includes the "favicon.ico" and "vercel.svg" files.

7. DOM Elements: Any DOM elements with specific id names used in the JavaScript functions will be shared across the files where these functions are imported and used.

8. Message Names: Any message names used for communication between different parts of the app will be shared across the files where these messages are sent or received.

9. Function Names: Any functions that are exported from one file and imported into another will be shared dependencies. The exact names will depend on the specific functions written in the code.
